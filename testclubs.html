                                            <strong>Designer Club</strong>
                                            intends to integrate inter-discipline minds to nurture ideas and engineer them into products. Club members are encouraged to brainstorm ideas using concept development groups (CDG) and the team identifies the skills required to engineer those concepts. Thus one of the major objectives would be to have training for dummies across the necessary engineering domains. Further there is always an expert lecture series on intellectual property rights and patenting part of the activities. This club is many times misconstrued with art & graphic design , which is not and is more of industrial design ! The various activities include CDGs conceiving ideas in structured brainstorming sessions, skill training sessions for dummies and also encourages to participate in inter-collegiate design contests. There had been interactions from industrial styling experts, concept designers etc. too in the past. Few developed concepts include innovative home appliances, medical instruments, table top holders etc. Interestingly computer engineering students have learnt CAD to mechanical simulation and mechanical students had sessions on embedded tools. 
                                            This makes the club versatile for any disciple engineering student to nurture and bring their ideas to reality!

                                            is an IIT Alumni initiative dedicated to bridging the gap between industry requirements and theoretical aspects of academics. Our aim at <b>PALS</b> is to ensure effective and seamless application of the skills one learns in closed classrooms and textbooks. Having an idea of what industries require from students is imperative to direct resources and channel efforts in the right direction, and it influences learning patterns among students to ensure the same.

                                            We at <b>PALS</b> believe that experience is an excellent way to learn, and we organize lectures delivered by industry experts to ratify the same and instill humility and a strong proclivity to learn in our beneficiaries. Learning is a continuous and inexhaustible process, and the desire to learn is the strongest tool one can have to come up with solutions for urgent problems in every domain.

                                            A conglomeration of nature enthusiasts, <b>Trekking Club</b> was founded on the belief of exploring nature unadulterated and unsullied. Paving our way through the dense forests, eerie cacophonies and the rocky plains, Trekking club provides an opportunity for all the students to distance themselves from the daily boisterousness of the lives and get enveloped by the serenity of the wild habitat. We, a group of 50 students and 1 faculty, embark ourselves in amazing, spine-chilling and ecstatic treks, which ultimately gets drilled in our minds and hearts as memorable events with unparalleled experiences.
