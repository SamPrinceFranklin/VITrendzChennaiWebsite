There may be different teams representing different genres, but we always have and always will represent our dance club as one.

                                            intends to integrate inter-discipline minds to nurture ideas and engineer them into products. Club members are encouraged to brainstorm ideas using concept development groups (CDG) and the team identifies the skills required to engineer those concepts. Thus one of the major objectives would be to have training for dummies across the necessary engineering domains. Further there is always an expert lecture series on intellectual property rights and patenting part of the activities. This club is many times misconstrued with art & graphic design , which is not and is more of industrial design ! The various activities include CDGs conceiving ideas in structured brainstorming sessions, skill training sessions for dummies and also encourages to participate in inter-collegiate design contests. There had been interactions from industrial styling experts, concept designers etc. too in the past. Few developed concepts include innovative home appliances, medical instruments, table top holders etc. Interestingly computer engineering students have learnt CAD to mechanical simulation and mechanical students had sessions on embedded tools. 
                                            This makes the club versatile for any disciple engineering student to nurture and bring their ideas to reality!
